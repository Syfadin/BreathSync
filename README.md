# BreathSync

What is it? an app for scheduling spotify songs to sync with a [Tummo breathing excercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ) (as done by [Wim Hof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Hof))

Round 1 can be set to 3 minutes in total 2 mins of deep breathing and 1 min breath hold each with a chosen song or playlist and every round is customizable
